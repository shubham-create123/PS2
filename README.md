# PS2

This ps is based on the famous deutsch-jozsa algorithm we are given a black box funtion which takes three bits string as input and return one bit as output.
so there are a total of eight possible combination of inputs so the people gets divided into groups who belives that the funciton is either: 


1) balenced function: gives 0 for half and 1 for the other half of input combinations
2) constant function: gives either 0 or 1 for all the possible input combinations


The classical way to solve this problem involve hit and trial by checking each and every possible combination of inputs and examining all the corresponding outputs to verify wheather the function is constand or balenced
